# Analog Seed

A very minimal Watchface for [Garmin Connect IQ](http://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/) 

Shows the time, a topbar for battery status, bottom bar for percent of step goal reached. All items are optional, so you can also configure it down to a black screen ;)

The main intention is to be a seed or skeleton app for further watchface projects.
